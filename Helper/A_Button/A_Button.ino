/*
  Button

 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin A0.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
 * pushbutton attached to pin A0 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin A0 from ground

 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.
